<h1>INTRODUCTORY NOTE TO PART II</h1>

<p>Whether you desire to break into the movies as
writer, actor or director, your most important consideration will be the scenario. In the scenario you will
find all the elements of the photoplay; everything is
built upon that as a foundation. The actor or director
who sincerely desires to do good work studies his
script assiduously. The ambitious writer analyzes not
only his own photoplays, but those of other people.</p>

<p>It is exceedingly difficult to talk technique to anyone
who has never read a scenario. For this reason we
have incorporated a "continuity" in this book. It is
the dramatic form of a screen story which we have
made as a special production. The titles, which are
the written inserts to be flashed on the screen, are in
capital letters. The inserts refer to such articles as
letters, telegrams, pictures, and the like, which may be
shown in close-up. The "iris" is the broadening or
narrowing of the frame of the picture to open or close
a scene, or to emphasize some particular object which
is "irised" upon. The "fade" effects are used very
much as the curtain of the legitimate stage is used to
open and close scenes. The abbreviation "Sp" means
"Speech," indicating that the title which follows is to
be spoken by the actor. Some of the quoted lines&#8212;the
ones not set off in capitals&#8212;are not shown on the
screen, but are merely given as a guide for the players.</p>

<p>Most of the directions concerning the scenes are also
given in capital letters. "EXTERIOR," or the abbreviated "EXT.," for example, refers to a scene
outdoors, while "INTERIOR" or "INT.," is an indoor
scene. The terms "LONG SHOT" and "CLOSE-UP"
refer to the distance at which the camera is placed
from the scene.</p>

<p>"Red Hot Romance" is played as a romantic melo-
drama, but is intended as a satire upon this very type
of story, with its incredibly heroic hero, its American
girl, its marines-to-the-rescue and all the rest of it.
Basil Sydney and May Collins played the parts of
Roland and Rosalie, and Victor Fleming was the
director.</p>



<h1>RED HOT ROMANCE</h1>

<p>T: IT'S BAD ENOUGH FOR SOME TO BOSS THE REST OF US WHILE THEY ARE
ALIVE, BUT THE LIMIT IS REACHED
WHEN THEY WANT TO KEEP RIGHT ON
AFTER THEY HAVE CASHED IN.</p>

<p>T: FOR INSTANCE, THERE WAS OLD HARDER N. STONE, THE VICE-PRESIDENT OF
THE BRITISH-AMERICAN INSURANCE CO.</p>

<p>1. LIBRARY, STONE HOME IN WASHINGTON. (Fade in.) Harder N. Stone, an old skin-
flint, is seated at his desk writing.</p>

<p>INSERT — Stone's hand writing the following:</p>

<p>"I, Harder N. Stone, of Washington, D. C,
hereby direct that, should I die before my son,
Roland Stone, he is to receive from my estate
the sum of $50.00 per week and the use of my
residence in Washington, D. C, until his twenty-
fifth birthday."</p>

<p>Stone sits back and regards what he has been
writing, smiles smugly, and then continues writ-
ing.</p>
<p>INSERT — Stone's hand writing the following:</p>

<p>"On his twenty-fifth birthday, provided he
has lived according to instructions herein set
down, my son, Roland Stone, is to receive his
inheritance at the hands of my chosen executor.
Lord Howe-Greene, of London, President of
the British-American Insurance Co."</p>

<p>Stone sits back and reads over what he has
written and is highly pleased. He then rings for
a servant and presently Briggs enters. He is a
little English butler, who has been in the family
for years. Stone turns to him and tells him that
he has just been making out his will. Briggs is
properly imoressed and Stone says to him:</p>

<p>SP: "BRIGGS, I HAVE PROVIDED IN MY WILL
THAT IF I DIE BEFORE MY SON YOU ARE
TO STAY ON WITH HIM AS LONG AS YOU
LIVE."</p>

<p>Briggs is highly pleased, thanks him, Stone
dismisses him, goes on writing. (Fade out.)
THE OLD BOY DID DIE, AS HE DESERVED TO, AND LEFT HIS SON AND
HEIR, ROLAND STONE, WITH NOTHING
TO DO BUT LIVE ON $50.00 PER WEEK.</p>

<p>2. ROLAND'S BEDROOM. (Fade in.) He is
lolling in bed in pajamas and dressing gown,
smoking a cigarette and opening a stack of bills
and reading them.</p>
<p>INSERT — top bill — tailor's bill with a balance from the
month before and about $275.00 for this month
with a note in heavy letters "PLEASE REMIT."
This one is turned over, and the second one is
from a club with a statement "You have this day
been posted for $179.00 and your credit is hereby
suspended until same is paid." This bill is turned
over and the third bill is from a florist's for $950.00
worth of flowers sent to Miss Rosalie Bird and
has a note reading: "Impossible for us to fill
any more orders until these bills are paid."</p>

<p>Roland puts down the bills in disgust, not
looking further, as he knows they're all alike.</p>

,p>Briggs, the butler, now enters and takes up
the breakfast tray which is lying on the bed
opposite beside Roland. Roland looks up to him,
then looks at the bills, and says:</p>

<p>SP: "HOW DO YOU EXPECT ME TO PAY
THESE BILLS ON $50.00 A WEEK?"</p>

<p>Briggs shrugs his shoulders as though he
had nothing to do with it, and suggests that
Roland's bills are too big. He then leaves. Ro-
land looks after him, disgusted, runs through a
few more bills, throws them on the floor and at
this juncture, Tom, Roland's valet, a big husky
negro with a child-like, innocent smile, enters the
room with letters, goes to Roland and hands him
the letters. Roland looks at them and sees they
are more bills, puts them down. Tom picks up
others from floor and gives them to Roland, much
to his disgust. He looks up to Tom and says:</p>

<p>SP: "YOU'RE A FINE 'SECRETARY' I WHAT
DO I PAY YOU FOR?"</p>

<p>Tom looks up at him, round-eyed and smiles
and says:</p>

<p>SP: "YOU DON'T."</p>

<p>This is a poser for Roland for a moment, he
finally regains his composure and says:</p>

<p>SP: "WELL, I AM GOING TO WHEN I GET MY
INHERITANCE NEXT APRIL."</p>

<p>Tom nods his head quizzically as he has heard
this many times before. Roland then picks up the
bills, runs through them again and says:</p>

<p>SP: "THE QUESTION NOW IS— HOW ARE WE
GOING TO LIVE UNTIL APRIL?"</p>

<p>He sighs, reaches over to a table which has a
little calendar on it, picks up the calendar, sees
that it is the 13th of January, and runs through
the pages very dubiously. He finally looks up
at Tom, shovifs him how many days they have to
live through on the calendar, and says:</p>

<p>SP: "I HAVEN'T A NICKEL AND I CAN'T
BORROW ANYTHING NOW. HOW ARE
WE GOING TO LIVE UNTIL APRIL?"</p>

<p>Tom looks about very dubiously. Finally he
gets an idea, he looks from one object of furniture to another, and his idea grows until he is
fairly beaming and he says:</p>

<p>SP: "THEY'S A MIGHTY LOT OF HOCKABLE
STUFF AROUND HEAH, BOSS!"</p>

<p>He indicates the things around the room, and
Roland is delighted with the idea. He picks up
the bunch of bills, looks at the top one.</p>

<p>INSERT— TAILOR'S BILL.</p>

<p>Roland then looks around for something to pay
that with and his eye falls upon an antique vase.
He jumps out of bed, takes the vase and hands
it to Tom together with the tailor's bill, saying
that that will pay for that. Roland looks at the
next bill.</p>

<p>INSERT— BILL FROM CLUB.</p>

<p>Roland then takes a couple of ornaments from
the mantel, gives them to Tom together with the
club bill saying that they will pay for that.
Roland then looks at the next bill.</p>

<p>INSERT— FLORIST'S BILL.</p>

<p>Roland then takes a picture from, the wall, leaving a discolored place behind it, saying that will
pay for that. He then thinks a moment and picks
up a little antique clock and hands it to Tom,
saying:</p>

<p>SP: "AND BUY HER SOME ORCHIDS WITH
THIS."</p>

<p>Tom grins, goes out loaded down with all the
junk. Roland looks after him, very pleased with
himself, and, probably thinking of his girl and
the orchids, smiles, and fade out.</p>

<p>T: INDICATING THAT IT'S TEA TIME.</p>

<p>3. EXTERIOR COLONEL BIRD'S HOUSE.
(Fade in.)</p>

<p>Roland comes down the street with a bunch
of orchids in his hand and goes up and rings
the bell.</p>

<p>T: COLONEL BIRD, OF VIRGINIA, WHO HAS
BEEN HANGING AROUND WASHINGTON
FOR THIRTY-FIVE YEARS, WAITING FOR
A JOB WHICH WAS FIRST PROMISED
HIM BY PRESIDENT CLEVELAND.</p>
<p>4 PARLOR, COLONEL BIRD'S HOUSE. Colonel Bird, seated at a desk, very busily reading
several large law books and making notes, trying
to "kid" himself into believing that he is busy.
A colored mammy presently shows in Roland,
who greets the Colonel very effusively. The
Colonel asks Roland to sit down, which he does.
The servant exits. The Colonel, not being very
greatly impressed with Roland, excuses himself
and goes on with his work, explaining that he
has some very important matters on hand.
Roland looks at him, smiles to himself, then looks
out expectantly toward the hall.</p>

<p>T: THE COLONEL'S DAUGHTER, ROSALIE,
THE LADY OF THE ORCHIDS.</p>

<p>5. HALLWAY, COLONEL'S HOUSE. Rosalie
comes down the stairs and enters the parlor.</p>

<p>6. PARLOR, COLONEL'S HOUSE. Rosalie
rushes over, greets Roland. The Colonel
rises until Roland and the girl are seated on a
sofa, when he sits and goes on with his work. Roland gives Rosalie the orchids. Rosalie
thanks him, but says:</p>

<p>SP: "ROLAND, YOU SHOULDN'T BUY ORCHID'S EVERY DAY."</p>

<p>She then points around to different vases in the
room, all of which are full of orchids. She holds
on to the orchids and gives Roland a little lecture
on economy, telling him he has no business to
spend his money so foolishly. And Roland says
he thought she liked orchids. She says she does
and he's a dear sweet boy to bring them, but he
sees she is not pleased and is correspondingly
depressed.</p>

<p>7. EXTERIOR COLONEL'S BIRD'S HOUSE.
A low rakish roadster drives up and out of it
gets Jim Conwell. He has a small sized package
in his hand.</p>

<p>CLOSE UP — And he runs up and rings the bell.</p>

<p>T: JIM CONWELL IS ONE OF THAT BROTHERHOOD OF DIPLOMATIC HANGERS-ON
WHO MAKE A SHADY LIVELIHOOD BY
DOING THE DIRTY WORK OF THE VARIOUS WASHINGTON EMBASSIES.</p>

<p>8. EXT. COLONEL BIRD'S PORCH. The col-
ored mammy opens the door, lets in Conwell,
takes his hat and coat and shows him into the
parlor.</p>

<p>9. PARLOR COLONEL BIRD'S HOUSE. The
colored mammy shows Conwell in, the old
Colonel jumps up from his desk, and greets him
very enthusiastically. His manner toward Conwell is very different from his manner toward
Roland. Rosalie then greets Conwell very
sweetly but with reserve and Roland, giving him
a dirty look, greets him as coldly as possible.
The old Colonel now gives up his work to join
the group. Conwell holds out his little package
toward Rosalie and says:</p>

<p>SP: "HERE'S A LITTLE THING I PICKED UP
IN AN ANTIQUE SHOP. I THOUGHT
YOU'D LIKE IT."</p>

<p>Rosalie puts down her orchids in Roland's
chair. She then takes the package, opens it up
and takes out Roland's clock. She lets out a cry of surprise and delight, then turns to Conwell
and says:</p>

<p>SP: "IT'S LOVELY! I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
A CLOCK LIKE THAT"</p>

<p>Roland looks at this, open-mouthed and in
absolute astonishment, sits down in his chair,
smashing the orchids. Rosalie then shows the
clock to the old Colonel and the two of them
rave over it, forgetting the existence of Roland, who finally comes to sufficiently to see that he's
sitting on something, gets up and picks up the
mashed orchids, looks at them disgustedly. The
clock is finally put in place on the mantel and
Rosalie comes back and joins Roland, who stands
looking ruefully at the flowers in his hand. He
dolefully shows them to her, and she, seeing he
is hurt, comforts him, telHng him he's a dear
boy and she loves the orchids. She takes them
from him and tenderly straightens them out,
but Roland is still in the dumps. Conwell is
now throwing a lot of "bull" at the old Colonel,
saying:</p>

SP: "I JUST SAID TO THE SECRETARY OF
STATE: 'YOU'RE NOT LOOKING VERY
WELL, ELIHU, I WISH YOU'D LET MY
OLD FRIEND, COLONEL BIRD, TAKE
SOME OF THE WORK OFF YOUR
HANDS.' "

He goes on spouting and the old Colonel fairly
eats it up. Finally, Roland, unhappy and jealous
and disgusted at Conwell, gets up and tells Ro-
salie he has to go. Rosalie begs him to stay in
her sweetest manner, but Roland takes another
look at Conwell, says no, he's got to go, says
good-by to Rosalie and says good-by to the
Colonel and Conwell, and leaves.
STREET EXT. COL. BIRD'S HOUSE.— Roland
comes out and goes dolefully down the street.
(Fade out.)

HALLWAY ROLAND'S HOUSE. Roland
enters, disheartened. Hangs up hat and coat
and stick and goes slowly into library.
10. LIBRARY ROLAND'S HOUSE. (Fade in.)
Tom is fussing about the room. Roland enters



RED HOT ROMANCE 61

the room, terribly depressed and upset and starts
to tell Tom about the scene that just took
place. He goes on talking about Conwell and
finally says:

SP: "THE OLD MAN STANDS FOR ALL OF
CONWELL'S BUNK AND THINKS HE'S
GREAT."

Tom is very sympathetic and tells Roland he
ought to settle the matter. Roland agrees with
him, pounds on the table, and says:

SP: "I THINK THE TIME HAS COME WHEN
I OUGHT TO TELL ROSALIE I LOVE
HER!"

Tom agrees with him, says that's absolutely
right. Roland says he knows it's right — the only
thing to do is to come to an understanding right
away. He then goes over to the telephone and
calls a number, and while he is waiting for the
number, he goes on talking to Tom, telling him
just how he is going to settle things and Tom
encourages him.

11. HALLWAY COLONEL BIRD'S HOUSE.
Rosalie comes dcwn the hall to the telephone
and answers it.

12. LIBRARY ROLAND'S HOUSE. Roland is
still talking to Tom, telling him how he's going
to lay down the law when he suddenly hears
Rosalie's voice over the 'phone. All his belliger-
ency oozes out. He smiles and stammers fool-
ishly and gulps and tries to get his courage up
as if he were going to lay matters right before
her and finally weakens and comes out with

SP: "HOW ARE YOU?"

13. HALLWAY COLONEL BIRD'S HOUSE.
Rosalie, wondering what the devil he's asking
her that for when he just left her, frowns quiz-
zically and says that she's feeling all right.

14. LIBRARY ROLAND'S HOUSE. Roland goes
on talking through the 'phone in a stammering
embarrassed sort of waj"-, and Tom keeps telling
him to go on and tell her what he said he was
going to. Roland tries to motion to Tom and
he goes on stammering and stuttering.

15. HALLWAY COLONEL BIRD'S HOUSE.



62 BREAKING INTO THE MOVIES

Rosalie still very quizzically listening to Roland.
She finally asks him what is the matter with him.

16. LIBRARY ROLAND'S HOUSE. Roland stam-
mering into the 'phone. Finally Tom, utterly
disgusted, comes over to the 'phone and yells in
it:

SP: '^HE'S TRYING TO ASK YOU TO MARRY
HIM, MISS ROSALIE! WILL YOU?"

Roland turns angrily to Tom, still holding the
receiver to his ear, and starts to berate Tom
soundly, when he suddenly hears something in
the telephone which stops him. He listens, over-
come with wonderment and finally says:

SP: "SAY THAT AGAIN 1"

17. HALLWAY COLONEL BIRD'S HOUSE.
Rosalie at the 'phone, laughing, says:

SP: "YES. OF COURSE I WILLI"

18. LIBRARY ROLAND'S HOUSE. Roland can
hardly believe his ears, makes her reiterate it,
then turns to Tom in great glee and says:

SP: "IT'S ALL RIGHT. SHE SAYS YES."

He then turns back to the 'phone and asks
Rosalie if she really means it. While he is talk-
ing to Rosalie, Tom goes over to a heavy couch,
pulls it out toward the hall. Roland still at the
'phone talking, turns and asks Tom what he is
doing. Tom still pulling the couch says:

SP: "AH'M GOING TO BUY YOU A ENGAGE-
MENT RING."

Roland smiles and nods, and suddenly thinks of
the clock episode, stops Tom, tells him to wait
a minute, then turns toward the telephone and
says:

SP: "WHAT WOULD YOU RATHER HAVE— A
RING OR A SOFA?"

19. HALLWAY COLONEL BIRD'S HOUSE.
Rosalie listening at the 'phone is utterly dumb-
founded at this odd request, she asks him to
repeat it, then finally still puzzled, says:

SP: "WHY, A RING, OF COURSE! YOU SILLY
BOY!"

20. LIBRARY ROLAND'S HOUSE. Roland listen-
ing at the 'phone, hears Rosalie wants the ring,
turns to Tom and tells him to go on and hock



RED HOT ROMANCE 63

the sofa. He then turns to Rosalie, starts in to
talk to her ecstatically over the 'phone, smiling,
as we fade out.

T: THAT NIGHT AT THE HANGOUT OF THE

FRINGE OF THE DIPLOMATIC SET.
2h A wop RESTAURANT. (Fade in.) This is
a typical $1.35 Table d'Hote joint. Seated at
the various tables are many diplomatic hangers-
on, all of them crooked and all looking out for
the main chance. Among them is a Mexican, a
Frenchman, an Englishman, a German, a Russian,
an Italian, a Chinaman, a Jap, a Bulgarian, a
Hindoo and their women — perhaps three or four
Americans, but the atmosphere is generally for-
eign, the waiters being Wops.

Seated at one table is Conwell alone. He is
eating spaghetti and looking very sourly about.

T: ENRICO DE CASTANET OF BUNKONIA.

Enrico is seated at a table talking to a very
attractive vamp type of a woman.

T: HIS LADY FRIEND (THE INTERNA-

TIONAL VAMP AND SPY), COUNTESS
PULLOFF DE PLOTZ.

The Countess is .listening very intently to
Enrico. Enrico goes on talking very earnestly,
and finally says:

SP: "YOU SEE, WE MUST HAVE A MAN WHO
CAN BE BOUGHT BODY AND SOUL."

The Countess agrees with him, and perhaps
suggests somebody, whom Enrico says would
never do. The Countess starts thinking again,
and, as she does, her ej-es wander over the room
and she sees Conwell, v/ho has just gotten up,
paid his bill and given the waiter a very small
tip, at which the waiter shows his disgust. Con-
well then turns to leaves the restaurant, starts
down toward Enrico and the Countess. The
Countess sees him, has a sudden idea that he
would be fine for the job and points him out to
Enrico. At this moment, Conwell has stopped
to talk to someone at one of the tables, Enrico
looks him over from head to foot, asks the Count-
ess if she is sure he can be handled; she assures
him he can.



64 BREAKING INTO THE MOVIES

SP: "HE WORKED FOR THE SHIPPING
BOARD."

Enrico agrees that he looks like a good bet,
and just at this moment Conwell comes past the
table, sees the Countess motion to him. He comes
over to the table, Enrico rises and the Countess
introduces him saying:
SP: "SENOR DE CASTANET IS MINISTER OF
WAR OF BUNKONIA."

Conwell is mildly interested in this fact. Enrico
then asks Conwell to sit down, so he takes a seat,
and the Countess then begins to get very confi-
dential. She looks around to see that no one
is looking, then getting their three heads together,
she says in whispered tones:
SP: "WE ARE ENGINEERING A LITTLE REV-
OLUTION DOWN IN BUNKONIA."

Conwell is a little more interested now. He
pricks up his ears a bit and casually glances
around to make sure no one is overhearing, then
looks to De Castanet for some information, and
De Castanet, with a quick glance around says
to Conwell: i

SP: "THE AMERICAN CONSUL HAS RE-
SIGNED AND A NEW ONE IS TO BE
APPOINTED NEXT MONTH."

Conwell is still more interested, asks Enrico
where do I come in? Enrico says, indicating
Madame:
SP: "I AM HERE TO SEE THAT THE 'RIGHT-
MAN IS APPOINTED."

Conwell says "Oh ho," he sees and looks at
the Countess, who nods her approval. He then
asks her where he comes in. With more mys-
terious looks, they get their heads very closely
together, and the Countess says:
SP: "WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU FOR
CONSUL? THE PICKINGS ARE GOING TO
BE FINE FOR THE 'RIGHT MAN.'"

Conwell considers a moment, smiles quizzically
and shakes his head and says:
SP: "NO, I'M IN WRONG—THE SENATE
WOULDN'T CONFIRM ME."

The Countess tries to argue with him but he



RED HOT ROMANCE 65

is obdurate and says there's no chance for him,
btJt as they are talking he is suddenly struck
■with a brilliant idea. He says, "Wait a minute."
They all wait and finally he speaks and says:

SP: "I'VE GOT JUST THE MAN FOR YOU!"
They are all attention and eager to know who
it is. He indicates that this must be very much
on the quiet and then says:

SP: "OLD COLONEL BIRD— FINE RECORD-
EASY TO HANDLE— BEEN WAITING
THIRTY-FIVE YEARS FOR A JOB."

The Countess indicates that she knows old
Bird and tells Enrico that he is ideal, that they
couldn't do better. Enrico asks if he can be
handled when the time comes. Conwell swells
up and tells him to leave that to him. It's
the easiest thing in the world. Enrico turns to
Madame, who backs up Conwell and Enrico is
then satisfied. Conwell then speaks up and
says:

SP: "I'LL GO ALONG AS SECRETARY AND
KEEP MY EYE ON THE OLD BOY."

They both express their approval of that, and
indicate that he will get part of the swag. The
Countess leans over and says rather tauntingly:

SP: "I SUPPOSE THE OLD BOY'S DAUGHTER
WILL GO ALONG, TOO!"

Conwell says he bets she will and winks the
other eye. The Countess laughs and Enrico
smiles, interested at the idea of a romance. He
and the Countess exchange glances. Conwell
then says:

SP: "REMEMBER— MUM'S THE WORD UNTIL

AFTER THE APPOINTMENT IS MADE"

They all agree to that and put their heads

together and go on with their scheming. (Fade

out.)

T: AND SO IT CAME TO PASS

22. PARLOR COLONEL BIRD'S HOUSE. (Fade
in.) An old trunk in the middle of the floor
and the Colonel and mammy are packing in his
books, papers, etc. The Colonel all full of busi-
ness and very busy. Rosalie is helping, but is
very sad over the matter.



66 BREAKING INTO THE MOVIES

23. EXTERIOR COLONEL BIRD'S HOUSE.
Roland rushes down the street with a newspaper
in his hand, runs up the steps and rings the
bell.

24. PARLOR COLONEL BIRD'S HOUSE. Ro-
salie looks up quickly, thinking that this must be
Roland. Mammy starts for the door but Rosalie
tells her she will answer the bell, and she runs
out into hall.

25. HALLWAY COLONEL BIRD'S HOUSE.
Rosalie runs to the door and opens it.

26. EXTERIOR COLONEL BIRD'S HOUSE.
Rosalie opens the door, and Roland rushes in.

27. HALLWAY COLONEL BIRD'S HOUSE.
Roland, full of excitement, grabs Rosalie, shows
her the article in the newspaper.

INSERT — Article in newspaper stating that Colonel Bird
has been appointed Consul of Bunkonia and that
he is to leave for there immediately with his
daughter and his Secretary, James Conwell.

Roland asks Rosalie if this is true. Rosalie
nods her head sadly, says that it is and

SP: "I DIDN'T KNOW A THING ABOUT IT
MYSELF UNTIL THIS MORNING."

Roland protests that she can't go away and
leave him, and Rosalie asks what she can do
and says that her father has waited for this all
his life and insists on taking her along. Roland
asks where her father is, she points into parlor,
and Roland tells her that he will see about
-whether she will be taken away or not, and
full of worry, rushes into the parlor followed
by Rosalie.

28. PARLOR COLONEL BIRD'S HOUSE.
Colonel Bird is helping mammy pack and Roland
rushes in followed by Rosalie. He goes to the
Colonel and protests against taking his fiancee
away from him. He puts his arm around Rosalie
and says that he wants to marry her now and
keep her. The Colonel can't see this at all, and
says:

SP: "IF YOU MARRY NOW. HOW ARE YOU
GOING TO SUPPORT HER?"

Rosalie turns to Roland and says that is the



RED HOT ROMANCE 67

trouble — that her father won't let her stay there
and marry him because he can't support her.
Roland then turns to the Colonel and says:

SP: "BUT, COLONEL, IN ANOTHER MONTH
EVERYTHING WILL BE ALL RIGHTl"

Rosalie seconds the motion and tries to per-
suade her father that everything will be all right,
but her father shakes his head, looks grimly at
Roland and says:

SP: "THAT'S WHAT CLEVELAND SAID TO ME
IN '89."

Roland looks discouraged and realizes that he
is up against a hard proposition in the old
Colonel, but tries to explain that if they can just
struggle along for a month he will have millions,
but the Colonel says:

SP: "WHEN YOU HAVE YOUR INHERITANCE
RIGHT IN YOUR HAND, COME DOWN TO
BUNKONIA AND GET HER."

Roland, much discouraged, still tries to argue
with the old boy, but he cuts him off and goes
on about his work. Roland then turns to Rosalie,
who by this time is in tears. At the sight of
Rosalie's tears, Roland forgets his own disap-
pointment, and putting his arm around her, leads
her off to a secluded corner out of sight of the
old Colonel, seats her and tries to comfort her,
putting his arm around her and saying:

SP: "THE FIRST OF APRIL IS MY BIRTHDAY.
I GET MY INHERITANCE THAT DAY AND
I'LL START AT ONCE FOR BUNKONIA."
At once Rosalie looks up at him with her eyes
full of tears and smiles wanly. Roland takes
her hand, wipes away her tears, kisses her and
says :

SP: "I'LL SEND YOU A CABLE EVERY
DAY!"

At this Rosalie is greatly cheered up, she looks
and sa3^s: "Will you, dear?" and he assures her
that he will and again kisses her. (Fade out.)

T: THE AMERICAN CABLE COMPANY DID

WELL THAT MONTH BUT LOOK WHAT
HAPPENED TO ROLAND'S HOUSE.
29. HALLWAY ROLAND'S HOUSE. (Fade in.)



68 BREAKING INTO THE MOVIES

View of hall without a piece of furniture, bric-a-
brac or pictures. (Dissolve out.)

30. LIBRARY ROLAND'S HOUSE. (Dissolve in.)
View of Library absolutely bare. (Dissolve out.)

31. ROLAND'S BEDROOM. (Dissolve in.) Bed-
room has nothing in it but one couch, one chair
and a soap box on which are Roland's mirror
and toilet articles.

Roland is asleep on the couch. Presently
Briggs enters, looks about at the devastated
room, then shaking his head over the laziness
of his master, goes over, wakes Roland up and
says:
SP: "I WISH YOU A HAPPY BIRTHDAY, SIR."

Roland wakes up, looks at him, rubs his eyes,
realizes that his probation is over. Tom enters
smiling with a telegram in his hand which he
gives to Roland who opens it and reads:
INSERT— TELEGRAM.

New York, March 31, 1920. "Arrive Washing-
ton four-forty to-morrow, April first, to deliver
inheritance. HOWE-GREENE."

Roland jumps out of bed, goes over and claps
Briggs on the back and shakes hands with him —
then shakes hands with Tom. Then makes Briggs
and Tom shake hands. Tells them both he's
going to have loads of money and they will be
paid. Roland then goes over to his soap box
on which is a calendar. He looks at page marked
"March 31." Tears it off and looks at page
marked "April 1."

He tears off the page with a flourish which
reads March 31st, turns it over, and, sitting on
the floor, writes on the back of it. Tom in the
meantime sends Briggs for his breakfast and
gets out Roland's clothes, brushing them with
great gusto. Roland finishes writing and reads
what he has written.
INSERT— WHAT ROLAND iS WRITING.

"Miss Rosalie Bird, Santo Grafto, Bunkonia. At
last the great day is here. Lord Howe-Greene
arrives to-day with my inheritance. Leave for
Bunkonia to-morrow to claim you as my bride.
Roland."



RED HOT ROMANCE 69

He reads it and tells Tom to send it. Tom takes
the message. Scratches his head and looks
around the room for something to hock. Roland
wants to know why he's hesitating, and he tells
him. Roland then says:

SP: "TAKE THE COUCH!"

Tom looks at the couch dubiously, then looks
at Roland and says: "Where are you going to
sleep to-night?" Roland, in an extravagant
manner and with a grand flourish, tells him to
take it away.

SP: "I WON'T BE ABLE TO SLEEP TO-NIGHT
ANYWAY!"

Tom goes over, picks up the couch and starts
out of the room with it. At the door, Roland
stops him, picks up the one remaining chair,
hands it over to him and says:

SP: "CABLE HER SOME ROSES WITH THIS!"
Tom takes the chair, starts for the door when
he suddenly thinks of the fact that Lord Howe-
Greene is due that morning, so he stops, turns to
Roland and says:

SP: WHAT DAT LORD HOWE-GREENE TO
SIT ON WHEN HE COMES?"

Roland says that's right, so he leaves the chair
and starts out with the couch. Briggs in the
meantime has entered with Roland's breakfast.
Puts breakfast on soap box. Roland tells him
to put the chair down in the hall. Briggs doleful.
Roland slaps him on the back — tells him to cheer
up. Briggs goes out shaking his head and Ro-
land sits on chair and starts his breakfast all
smiles. (Fade out.)

T: THE NEW MILLIONAIRE.

32. FRONT OF ROLAND'S HOUSE. (Fade in.)
Roland's taxi drives up and stops, followed by
Tom's. Roland and Lord HowejGreene with
portfolio get out. Tom also gets out with bags.
Howe-Greene starts up walk. Tom stops Roland
and shows him three cents — all he has and whis-
pers to him, saying:

SP: "HOW DO I PAY THE TAXI?"

Roland signifying that he can't be annoyed with
such little things, says grandiloquently:



70 BREAKING INTO THE MOVIES

SP: "TELL THEM TO WAITl"

He follows Lord Howe-Greene up the \va\\c
while Tom goes to the taxis and tells them to wait.
Then he follows with bags.

33. RECEPTION HALL ROLAND'S HOUSE.
It is perfectly bare. Briggs is just coming down
the stairs carrying the one chair that is left, he
puts it down, looks around at the bare hall,
shakes his head sadly, dusts off the one chair,
then looks up quickly at hearing bell ring, goes
over to the door.

34. FRONT OF ROLAND'S HOUSE. Briggs
opens the door and lets Roland and Lord Howe-
Greene in followed by Tom with bags.

35. HALLWAY ROLAND'S HOUSE. Roland and
Lord Howe-Greene enter, followed by Tom and
Briggs. Briggs is delighted to see the old Eng-
lishman but is terribly chagrined at the condition
of the house. He takes Lord Howe-Greene's
coat and hat, and Roland engages Lord Howe-
Greene in talking, then motions to Tom to get
the chair into the library. Tom sneaks the
chair around behind Lord Hovv'C-Greene and into
the library.

36. LIBRARY. Tom sneaks the chair in, puts it
down near the fireplace.

37. HALLWAY ROLAND'S HOUSE. Roland
noticing that Tom has the cliair placed, escorts
Lord Howe-Greene into the library with a grand
flourish.

38. LIBRARY. Tom is standing behind the chair.
Lord Howe-Greene and Roland enter. Tom seats
Lord Howe-Greene very ceremoniously in the
chair. Lord Howe-Greene looks around the
empty room and is astounded. He turns to
Roland and says: "I say, old fellow, the place looks'
rather beastly bare? Where's the furniture?"

Roland thinks for a moment, looks at Tom; Tom
does some quick heavy thinking and finally says,
very graciously:
SP: "WE SENT THE FURNITURE OUT TO BE
CLEANED IN HONOR OF YOUR COMING."
Roland smiles in relief and in approval of Tom,
and then says:



RED HOT ROMANCE 71

SP: "THE CLEANERS ARE ON STRIKE SO
THEY DIDN'T GET IT DONE IN TIME."
Lord Howe-Greene blandly accepts the explana-
tion and thanks him for his thoughtfulness.
Roland, who has been fondling the portfolio, can
hardly wait for it to be opened, and he gives it to
Lord Howe-Greene and then goes and stands by
the mantel with Tom. Lord Howe-Greene fishes
out the papers, finally comes to the will and
starts to read the glad news. He reads for a
moment and then

INSERT — "That providing said Roland Stone has car-
ried out previous instructions of the will, his
father provides as follows:"

Roland, overcome with impatience, begins to
get even more interested. Lord Howe-Greene
clears his throat and goes on reading:

INSERT — "I bequeath to my son, Roland Stone, one
unencumbered position in the Anglo-American
Insurance Co. as soliciting agent with a guar-
antee of $25.00 per week."

Roland looks in astonishment at Lord Howe-
Greene as does also Tom. Lord Howe-Greene
clears his throat again and goes on reading:

INSERT — "If at the end of one year, the business said
Roland Stone procures for the company has
proven profitable, the same will be a proof of
his good business judgment, and he is then to
come into possession of my entire fortune."

Roland stares simply open-mouthed in aston-
ishment and disappointment, while Tom can
hardly believe his ears.

INSERT — "If on the other hand, the company at the
end of one year has suffered a loss through the
agency of said Roland Stone, my entire fortune
shall be given to the support of the Washington
Home for Incurables."

Roland, absolutely dumbfounded by the news,
stares at Lord Howe-Greene, then looks around
at Tom. Tom looks at Roland accusingly.

Roland then turns in discouragement and asks
Lord Howe-Greene if there's any more. Lord
Howe-Greene goes on reading:

INSERT — "It is further provided that conditions under



72 BREAKING INTO THE MOVIES

which said Roland Stone is to work, shall be
subject to the approval of Lord Howe-Greene."
Roland is utterly unable to take all of this in,
and he insists on reading it himself. Lord Howe-
Greene hands it to him, and Roland starts in to
read it as though he could hardly believe his
eyes. Tom looks over his shoulder, and, finally
disgusted with the whole proceeding, he goes
over toward the window, stands there dejectedly
and looks out.
