<section class="subtitle">
<p>HOW TO DRESS FOR A PICTURE</p>
</section>

<p>There is only one drawback to the pleasurable life
of the movie actor or actress. They draw big salaries ;
they get their names in the papers and are deluged
with "fan" letters to such an extent that special postal
departments are installed in their offices; the work is
interesting and the hours comparatively short. But,
alas, they have to have a lot of clothes.</p>

<p>To be sure, the buying of clothes is a most pleasurable experience to all women and to many men. And,
forsooth, if they draw big salaries, why cavil about
the cost of replenishing a wardrobe every now and
again?</p>

<p>The fact is, the wardrobes are not replenished every
now and again; they are constantly in a state of replenishment, and for that reason the average actor's
bank account, no matter how big the salary, is also in
constant need of being similarly replenished. For
every new scene is apt to require completely new
gowns and suits, and, in the case of the actors who
play the more important parts, no two suits or gowns
can be worn in any two pictures or the fans will be
sure to discover it and write uncomplimentary letters
to the studio.</p>
<section class="image1">
</section>
<p>In the case of the beginner, however, no such expenses need be met if he or she has one complete wardrobe to start with.
People playing minor characters must dress for the part at their own expense,
but no one notices or cares whether they wear the
same clothes with which they recently graced the
studio next door. If they play a part requiring a special dress or uniform the management will supply it
without charge.</p>

<p>It is rather difficult for a newcomer to the movies
to know exactly what clothes are required for their
wardrobe. Therefore we are including the following
comments on clothes and styles, as applied to motion
picture work:</p>

<p>Men should have at least three business suits, one
of which should be light and one dark.</p>

<p>For summer scenes, white flannels, with a blue coat
and a soft shirt&#8212;<em>not</em> a sport shirt&#8212;are required.
White duck shoes complete this outfit. Tweed suits
are the proper thing for wear in the country club
scenes and in most pictures calling for scenes on English estates.</p>

<p>For dress wear three outfits are necessary. There is
the cutaway for afternoon weddings, society teas, and
so forth, a Tuxedo for club scenes and semi-dress occasions, and finally, full dress for balls and dinners where
ladies are in the scene. A dark four-in-hand or bow
tie, with a stand-up or wing collar, should be worn
with the cutaway, and regulation dress bow ties, black
with the dinner coat and white with the dress suit.
These clothes are an essential part of a motion picture
actor's outfit.</p>

<p>The great difficulty with young actors is a tendency
to overdress and to attempt to hide bad tailoring
with a flashy design and a freak cut of the coat. Since
clothes are an actor's stock in trade, he should patronize only the best, if the most expensive tailors, and stick
to conservative lines unless the part requires eccentric
dressing. Jewelry should be avoided, unless called
for in the character ; cuff links and a watch chain are
all that should be worn, with the exception of dress
studs with the dinner or dress coat.</p>

<p>Girls will need a simple afternoon suit and an outer
coat to match. They must have two summer frocks,
a sailor blouse with a dark skirt, negligee, and an
evening gown and wraps. Hats to match are necessary, of course, as are dancing slippers and white duck
shoes.</p>

<p>The evening gown is perhaps the most important
part of the young actress's wardrobe, since she is more
apt to be called in for ball and dinner scenes than
any other. Simplicity should be the keynote of such
gowns. Simple French models are very attractive, but
few women can wear them well, since most American
girls are too broad in the shoulders for the Parisian
styles.</p>

<p>Clothes for character parts must be assembled on
the moment according to the demands of the director
and the imagination of the actor or actress. Realism
is the great essential of character dressing. To wear
the rags of a vaudeville tramp in the movies would
turn the picture into a slapstick comedy. A real
tramp's clothes are a mighty different matter.</p>

<p>The greatest difficulty which a casting director
experiences is that of finding people to play the part of
society folk. These parts require an understanding
of drawing-room manners and ballroom etiquette, and
the ability to wear smart clothes. If the clothes are
not up to the moment they will be obsolete when the
picture reaches the country at large, and the audiences
will think that because the styles are out of date the
picture is out of date also. Also if any extreme
styles are worn they are sure to be out of date when
the picture is shown. In the same way, the slightest
error in etiquette is sure to be noted and commented
upon. It is more of a trick than one might think
to know, at a moment's notice, how to act as best man
at a fashionable wedding, or how to serve a ten-course
dinner according to the latest vogue.</p>

<p>The best way is to dress conservatively and to act
as any well bred person might be expected to. A
man who fails to take off his hat upon entering a
fashionable house would be laughed at. A man who
took it off with a grand flourish would be hooted out.
Recently a director read in a certain short story that
the Newport set had instituted the custom of supplying
a single green glove for each dinner guest to wear
while the olives were served. This was merely a bit
of satire on the part of the story writer&#8212;but the
director took it seriously, and instituted the fad in a
dinner scene with dire results when the picture was
shown to the newspaper critics.</p>



<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>


<section class="subtitle">
<p>
MOVIE MANNERS
</p>
</section>


<p>This chapter does not deal so much with how to
act in a picture as how to act in a studio.</p>

<p>Motion picture people live, more or less, in a world
of their own. It is a world which may seem a bit topsy
turvy to the outsider, with its own peculiar customs,
and a greater freedom from restraint than is customary
in the conventional world outside. Examined
a bit closer, these outlandish ideas appear to be the
very same ones which are always associated with
artists &#8212;a bohemian spirit which is the same whether
in Hollywood or the Latin Quarter of Paris.</p>

<p>If the newcomer to the studio wishes to establish
himself as a bona fide member of the movie world
he must always remember that no matter how cynical
they may seem, no matter how pessimistically they
may talk, these people, in the bottom of their hearts,
consider a photoplay a form of art and themselves as
artists. The actor or director or author who does
really good work, who has something new to offer, or
who at least is sincere in his desire to do something
big and fine in the motion pictures, will always be
tolerated no matter how bizarre his character in other
respects. In short, people are ranked according to
their artistic understanding rather than according to
their ancestry, their bank account or their morals.</p>

<p>Most of the leaders of the motion picture world have
risen from poverty and obscurity, a fact which
 accounts for the democracy which prevails in the studio.</p>

<p>There are a few rules which beginners would do
well to follow. Here they are:</p>

<p>Be modest. Because you don't understand why
something is done, don't believe it is all nonsense.
And remember that you have ever so much to learn
about the business.</p>

<p>Don't criticize.</p>

<p>Try your best to please everyone, particularly the
director, whose shoulders are carrying the
responsibility for the whole production and whose manner may
be a bit gruff &#8212;as it usually is when a man is laboring
under a heavy load.</p>

<p>Don't be ashamed of being in the movies. If you
think movies are a low-brow form of making a living
your associates will surely become aware of your
state of mind and you will be quietly frozen out.</p>

<p>In the old days of the movies social status in the
studio was determined by a curious system, based
upon the pay envelope. Actors &#8212;for the movie world
is composed for the greater part of actors &#8212;are classed
as stars, the "leads," the "parts," the "bits," the
"extras" and "mobs." The star is, of course, the
highly paid actor or actress who is the feature of the
production; the "lead" is the leading man or woman
who plays opposite the star; the "parts" include all
those characters which appear on the program &#8212;the
minor characters of the play; the "bits" are those who
are called on to perform a bit of individual action, such
as the butler who opens the door, or the chauffeur
who drives the car, but who have no real part in the
play; the extras are simply members of the crowd, as
the ballroom throng, while a mob is just a mass of
people, like an army or the audience at a football
game.</p>

<p>The large producing companies frequently give
elaborate dinners, seating three or four hundred people,
and under this ridiculous old system the star sat at
the head of the table, with the "leads" near at hand.
Then came the "parts," then the "bits," and finally,
away down at the foot of the table, were the "extras."
In the same way directors, assistant directors, studio
managers, and so forth, were graded down according
to how much money they drew from the cashier every
week.</p>

<p>To-day all this snobbery has passed away. The
movie world has its smart set and its slums, as in any
other world, but the criterion is artistic worth, not
money. We know of one rather unpleasant personality
who has risen to stardom, but is completely ignored
by the lesser lights of the profession despite this star's
attempts to break into "film society."</p>



<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<section class="subtitle">
<p>READING YOUR PART</p>
</section>

<p>On the legitimate stage actors and actresses are
called on to read their parts before beginning
rehearsals. In the movies the part is read to them.
Before the company begins to make even the first
scene in a photoplay the scenario writer and director
call a meeting and rehearse the company, reading
the scenario and explaining the meaning of each scene.
If the author and director are wise the story is then
carefully rehearsed clear through, scene by scene,
before anything is photographed. In this way the
actors learn the sequence of their scenes and the
relation of their parts to other parts and to the whole.</p>

<p>It is up to you to make the best of your part.
Secure a copy of the scenario, or at least of your scenes,
as soon as possible. Then go over the story as many
times as possible, trying to grasp the relationship of
your own character to that of the other characters in
the story. Work out your own conception of the part.</p>

<p>Perhaps at first the director will never give you a
chance to do a piece of original acting. He will work
out every bit of action for you. Eventually, however,
your opportunity will come to "create a part," and you
must be ready for it.</p>

<p>All the action of a motion picture story is contained
in the numbered scenes of the scenario. Your bit of
acting will be in one or more of these scenes. Here
is a sample bit of one of our own scenarios, based
on the stage play "Mama's Affair," which we recently
wrote for Constance Talmadge. These are the last
few scenes of the photoplay:</p>

<section class="play1">
Eve watches her mother go out, then turns to
the doctor, goes to him, gives him her hand, and
says very quietly:

SP: "GooD-BY, Doctor."

The doctor looks at her, astonished, and says,
"What *" Eve looks up at him sternly and says :

SP: "Good-by; I Can Hardly Hope to See You
Again."

She then starts out the door. The doctor hurries
after her, stops her, and says, "What do you
mean ?" Eve turns to look at him, and then says
very calmly :

SP : "I Shall Be Leaving To-Morrow.''

The doctor, taken aback, steps back a couple of
steps, looks at her in astonishment, and says :

SP : "I Just Told You That I'd Marry You !" &gt;-^
Eve looks at him commiseratingly, smiles a cyn-
ical smile, and says :

SP: "You Just Told Me You Would Take Me in
BECAUSE You See No Way to Prevent My Be-
coming » Chronic Neurasthenic.'*
The doctor looks at her, flabbergasted at the
plain way in which she is putting things. She
then goes on and says :

SP : "You Don't Want Me, But You'll Take Me

IN AS You'd Take a Patient into a Hospital,"

The doctor looks at her, tries to speak, stammers,
stops, not knowing what to say. Eve then takes
a step toward him, smiles commiseratingly, and
says:

SP: "You Don't Have to Do That. I Have
Learned How to Handle Mama. You
Don't Have to Worry about My Health."
The doctor looks at her, surprised at this new
Eve, who is in no need of him at all in his pro-
fessional capacity. Eve looks at him, throws
out her arms with gestures of complete victory
over all her worries, and says :

SP: "I AM Going Back to New York, and I am
Going to Live."

Eve then turns, starts, goes toward the door
and starts to go out. The doctor looks at her,
struggles with himself, worries over the fact
that he is losing her, goes toward her, and says :
"Eve!" She turns, looks at him, and says:
"Yes?" He looks at her helplessly, trying to
find words to express himself, and then says :

SP: "I Can't Let You Go Like This."

Eve looks at him calmly, and asks why. The
doctor looks around helplessly, stalls a moment,

, and then says:

SP: "Because I Love You."

Eve looks at him a moment, and then, dropping
all her pose, simply overcome with intense re-
lief, she says :

SP: "Well, That's What I've Been Trying to
Get at."
The doctor rushes over to her, grabs her, takes
her in his arms, looks into her face, and says:
SP: "You Bold-faced, Shameless Little Dar-
ling."
Then gives her a good kiss, and we fade out.
</section>

<p>You will observe that in the scenario there are many-
lines written in for the actors to speak which never
appear on the screen (only those in capitals are shown
on the screen). This is to give the cast a chance to
say the things they would say in real life under the
same circumstances, and so to make the scene entirely
natural. The actor speaks all the lines in small type
and also those in the capital letters, following the
abbreviation "SP," which stands for "Spoken Title."</p>

<p>Contrary to common belief, the actors really speak
the words of their lines. There was a day when the
hero, kissing the heroine in the final close-up, might
say something like "Let's go out and get a cheese
sandwich, now that this is over." But just about this
time large numbers of lip-readers began to write in to
the producers, kicking against this sort of thing. It
seems that constant attendance at the movies develops
a curious power of following a speech by watching
the character's lips. And from that day the slapstick
comedians who used to swear so beautifully before
the camera and the heroines of the serial thrillers who
used to talk about the weather in their big scenes
began to speak their proper lines.</p>
